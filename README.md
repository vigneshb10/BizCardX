# BizCardX
I have developed a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.

Introduction
Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's graphical user interface (GUI). The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.

Features
The BizCardX offers a wide range of features which helps you extract and analyze data from bunsiness cards. Some of the key features include:

Retrieve image data: Get data on hthe busiess card uploaded as imaged. The data from images are extracted using easyOCR.

Displaying Data: The data extracted will be displayed using the streamlit application.

Data storage: Store the collected data in a SQL database for easy retrieval and future reference.

Technologies used
Python

The complete project has been implemented using python. Libraries such as Pandas, Numpy were used.

SQL

SQL was used as the database for the project and the collected data was stored in SQL.

Streamlit

Streamlit was used for visualtization and all the results were run in streamlit.

Working of the project
Upload the business card using the browse option. Once the file is selected click on extract and upload to fetch the data from the card and stor it in sql.
